# Terra Launch-With

Dockstore integrates with the Terra platform, allowing you to launch WDL-based workflows from Dockstore in Terra.  Here is some
information on what that looks like from a user point of view in a mini tutorial.

## Exporting into Terra

When browsing WDL workflows from within Dockstore, you will see a "Launch with Terra" button on the right. The currently selected
version of the workflow will be exported.

If not logged into Terra, you will be prompted to login. Otherwise, or after login, you will be presented with the following screen.

You will need to pick a workspace to export it into. You can either select an existing workspace or create a new one.

Then hit the "Import" button and continue from within the Terra interface to configure and run your workflow.

Note that you may want to double-check that the workflow specifies a runtime environment (docker, cpu, memory, and disks) to avoid using limiting defaults on Terra.
See more [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview).

## Limitations
1. While we support launching of WDL workflows, tools as listed in Dockstore are currently not supported.
1. Terra does not currently support file-path based imports.  Importing a workflow with file-based imports will result in error.  See the [converting file-based imports doc](/language-support/#converting-file-path-based-imports-to-public-https-based-imports-for-wdl) for more info.
1. Only the WDL language is supported.
