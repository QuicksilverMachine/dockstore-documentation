# DNAnexus Launch-With

Dockstore integrates with the DNAnexus platform, allowing you to launch WDL-based workflows from Dockstore in DNAnexus.  Here is some
information on what that looks like from a user point of view in a mini tutorial.

## Exporting into DNAnexus

When browsing WDL workflows from within Dockstore, you will see a "Launch with DNAnexus" button on the right. The currently selected
version of the workflow will be exported.

If not logged into DNAnexus, you will be prompted to login. Otherwise, or after login, you will be presented with the following screen.

You will need to pick a folder to export it into. You can either select a folder from an existing project, or you can create a new project.

Then hit the "Submit" button and continue from within the DNAnexus interface to configure and run your workflow.

## Limitations
1. While we support launching of WDL workflows, tools as listed in Dockstore are currently not supported.
1. Only the WDL language is supported.
